# CI Build Configuration
# =======================
# This file controls which platform builds run during PR checks.
# Agents should modify this file based on platforms affected by the ticket.
#
# Usage:
# - Set platforms to `true` to enable build during PR checks
# - Set platforms to `false` to skip build during PR checks
# - The "quality" job (ktlint, detekt) always runs regardless of settings
# - Full builds (all platforms) always run on main, release/*, and fix/* branches
#
# Branch-based auto-detection:
# - android/* branches: Auto-enables android build
# - ios/* branches: Auto-enables ios build
# - desktop/* branches: Auto-enables desktop build
# - web/* branches: Auto-enables web build
# - feature/*, bugfix/*: Uses this config file
#

# areas of the codebase will be affected by your changes.
